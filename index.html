                    <b>Biography</b>
                    Sergio is the founder and director of the Quantum Light-Matter Cooperative, a research consortium at
                    various institutions across California whose mission is to understand, design, and ultimately
                    control light-driven physical processes to help solve interconnected socio-technological challenges.
                    The cooperative's main research approach is to develop novel tools and frameworks to record the
                    smallest, fastest, and most elusive constituents of nature in action. This is called quantum
                    filmmaking.

                    <!-- <b>Research Overview</b> <br></br>
                    Professor Carbajo’s research examines emerging frontiers in ultrafast photon sciences and
                    light-matter interactions through the following fields: life science, biochemistry, quantum optics
                    and information sciences, and environmental and chemical engineering.
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Quantum optics, ultrafast and nonlinear optics, and structured photonics</li>
                        <li>Ultrafast sciences & molecular dynamics, (soft) condensed matter physics</li>
                        <li>Particle accelerators and X-ray free electron lasers</li>
                        <li>Critically representative science and technology, and queered science and technology studies
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <b>How their research helps humanity</b> <br></br>
                    Exercises representative science, which mandates not only diverse and inclusive researchers but also
                    requires a continual examination of the interconnectedness of normative logics and hierarchies of
                    power
                    with how scientific knowledge is produced. Queering specific normalized categories in physical
                    sciences
                    and engineering, and mapping linkages with systems of political and economic power, humanities, and
                    social
                    sciences has a unique capacity to educate the STEM workforce and research activities to critically
                    examine
                    their role and responsibility in shaping society.

                    <b>Biography</b>
                    Professor Jay’s research integrates field and laboratory approaches to better understand the
                    geochemical and microbial processes that govern the fate of contaminants in the environment.
                    Specific interests include the geochemical and microbial methylation of mercury by sulfate-reducing
                    bacteria (the end-product of this reaction, methylmercury, is a potent neurotoxin with a very strong
                    tendency to bioaccumulate), the mobilization of arsenic in groundwater, and the persistence of fecal
                    indicator bacteria and pathogens in beach sediment. Understanding the cycling of contaminants in
                    aquatic systems allows us to better assess and minimize hazards associated with environmental
                    contamination, and to more accurately predict effects of environmental perturbations. Professor
                    Jay’s research evaluates how humans affect the world around us, along with determining ways to
                    improve the world by examining the coastal water quality, heavy metals in the environment, and the
                    environmental proliferation of antibiotic resistance. In addition she analyzes how environmental
                    education can diminish the carbon footprint of dietary choices.

                    <b>Biography</b>
                    Dino Di Carlo is a professor, inventor, and entrepreneur with >170 publications and >60 issued
                    patents. He is the Armond and Elena Hairapetian Endowed Professor in Engineering and Medicine at
                    UCLA, Vice Chair of the Bioengineering Department, and Deputy Director of the National Science
                    Foundation Engineering Research Center focused on Precision Advanced Technologies and Health Systems
                    for Underserved Populations. His academic research has focused at the interface of micro &
                    nanosystems, data science, and the ultimate limits of biology (single cells and molecules). Over the
                    last 10 years, Dr. Di Carlo co-founded seven startup companies in life science research tools,
                    diagnostics, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries.
                    <!-- <b>Research Overview</b> <br></br>
                    Professor di Carlo’s research revolutionizes the biotech industry by developing interfaces that
                    allow for various applications, such as disease diagnosis, therapeutic discovery, tissue
                    regeneration, and directed evolution. Utilizing microfluidics, microfabrication, and
                    nanotechnologies, these interfaces expand the boundaries of biology due to their structure
                    consisting of cells and molecules.
                    <br></br>
                    <b>How their research helps humanity</b> <br></br>
                    The interface is easily accessible and can help detect and treat diseases early and in a
                    cost-effective manner. The affordability can minimize healthcare costs, and the early detection can
                    increase health span. The development of sustainable biofuels pushes us in the right direction of
                    ensuring food and energy sustainability.
